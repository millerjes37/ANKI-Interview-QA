Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong foundation in policy analysis, strategic communication, and stakeholder engagement, which I am eager to apply in a dynamic work environment. Currently, I am the Public Relations and Marketing Manager at Kroger Gardis and Regas LLP. In this role, I have successfully developed and executed comprehensive communication strategies that significantly enhanced our firms public and digital media presence. One of my proudest achievements was coordinating with board members and media stakeholders to align our messaging with organizational goals, particularly in legislative and educational initiatives. Additionally, I managed our WordPress-based website, ensuring it effectively represented our brand and facilitated user engagement. Prior to this, I served as a Summer Law Clerk and CIBE Consultant at the same firm. This experience allowed me to deeply immerse myself in the world of policy-making and stakeholder engagement. I led internal meetings on regulatory relief, met with legislators, and drafted policy documents that addressed critical issues like mental health facilities in schools. These tasks required not only a thorough understanding of the policy landscape but also the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly and persuasively. During my time at Wabash College, I interned with the Advancement Office, where I played a key role in organizing and running events focused on the stewardship of gifts.

Additionally, I actively engaged with students, faculty, and alumni to solicit donations, demonstrating my ability to build and maintain relationships with diverse groups. Beyond my professional roles, I am the founder of Civitas Limited, a startup in its seed phase that leverages advancements in language models to create a comprehensive stakeholder management system. This venture reflects my passion for using technology to streamline and enhance government affairs, making it more accessible and efficient. In terms of technical skills, I am proficient in R, Python, and various data analysis tools. My GitHub portfolio showcases a range of projects that I have containerized for ease of deployment, illustrating my commitment to continuous learning and practical application of my skills. Moreover, my involvement in Phi Delta Theta fraternity, where I served as Vice President, Rush Chairmen, and Risk Manager, has honed my leadership and project management abilities.
